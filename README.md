# Hello! I'm Jola :smile:

## My Journey

I started as a physiology student doing marketing on the side, with a gnawing
sense of disillusionment.
Something wasn’t right, but I didn’t know what to do next.  

For my final project, I studied the relationship between diet and cognitive performance,
handling small datasets, identifying key patterns, and presenting my findings.
This opened my eyes to the power of data in understanding and improving human
behaviour.  

What I loved most about marketing was its emphasis on optimization—
understanding where a persona was in their customer journey and using their
digital footprints to create personalized and meaningful experiences.  

## Finding my footing

Currently, I’m pursuing data and computer science at MIT Emerging Talent.  
My background nurtured a curiosity about neurobehaviour and business,
while deepening my appreciation for how data creates impactful solutions across fields.

I'm working toward building a solid foundation in data science
to create targeted solutions that meet people where they are.
