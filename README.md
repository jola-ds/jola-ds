## Hello! I'm Jola :smile:

I‚Äôm a data science learner passionate about using data to understand people and
optimize systems. My background in physiology and marketing sparked my curiosity
about behaviour and decision-making, which I now pursue through the MIT Emerging
Talent Data Science program.

I‚Äôve developed a foundation in Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine
learning, and research methods, and applied these skills to projects in health,
digital inclusion, and other domains. These experiences continue to strengthen
both my technical competence and my ability to ask meaningful questions of data.

Currently, I‚Äôm focused on sharpening my skills in Statistics, ML, and applied
research.

### Goal

- Build a portfolio of end-to-end data science projects

---

### Data Analysis and Modelling

- [EDA_ML_Notebooks](https://github.com/jola-ds/eda_and_ml_notebooks):
This repository contains small-scale exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine
learning tasks.

### Projects

- [Bitcoin - Ethereum Pipeline & Analysis](https://github.com/jola-ds/crypto_portfolio_analysis)
  A Python-based system for fetching, processing, and analysing cryptocurrency market
  data with focus on comparative trend analysis, risk assessment, and correlation dynamics.

  **Methods**: Python, API, Qualitative analysis

- [**Offline by Design: A Collaborative Data Science Project**](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-24-repo)  
  Investigates the digital exclusion of disabled entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan
  Africa using a qualitative-driven mixed-methods approach (manual coding + NLP).
  
  **Methods**: Python, NLP (TF-IDF, BERTopic), Thematic analysis

- [**Disease Diagnosis Prediction**](https://github.com/jola-ds/disease-diagnosis)  
  Originally developed during a hackathon, this project features a baseline ML
  model predicting disease from patient-reported symptoms and demographics. It
  includes a synthetic dataset (~10k patient records) generated for reproducibility
  and epidemiological realism.  
  
  **Methods**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, synthetic data generation

### About me, Unplugged
